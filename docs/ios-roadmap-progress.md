# iOS roadmap slice progress

State file for the [`build-ios-app`](../.claude/skills/build-ios-app/SKILL.md)
skill. The skill reads this file on every invocation to find the next slice to
build, and rewrites it as part of each committed slice. You can hand-edit the
**Next slice** prompt below to steer what gets built next — the skill uses
whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`ios-roadmap.md`](./ios-roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, separation of concerns) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- This is a **separate track** from the web roadmap's
  [`roadmap-progress.md`](./roadmap-progress.md); the two never collide.
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken
  in milestone order — never a whole milestone at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline

Nothing built yet. The web app (`src/`) is complete through web-roadmap v6 and is
the source of the reusable `@core` logic. The iOS app does not exist; `mobile/`
has not been created.

The first target is **M0 — Foundation: Expo app + shared-core reuse**.

**M5 — Practice depth: COMPLETE** (slices 23–38). The full training suite is on device:
mistakes review, per-range/per-hand stats, weakest-hands, mistakes-only drill, accuracy
heatmap, build-from-memory, practice-mode picker, timed drill, swipe-to-answer + haptics,
session history, spaced repetition (record + due-badge + streak), and the multi-action
cluster (editor, quiz, notation). **M6 — Advanced training** is underway: board explorer
(slice 39), range-vs-board overlay (slice 40), and postflop decision practice (slice 41).
**Combo cluster COMPLETE** (slices 42–45): combo explorer, `ComboSelector` component, per-hand
combo refinement persisted as `comboSelections` in the editor, and the blocker-aware combo drill
(a practice mode dealing unblocked combos, honoring `comboSelections` via `selectionForRange`).
**Mixed-frequency cluster COMPLETE** (slices 46–49): the `MixedStrategyEditor` component, a
frequency-editor screen persisting `mixedStrategies`, a primary-action quiz, and notation
import/export. The range diff view (slice 50) and the per-hand notes editor (slice 51 — `handNotes`, reached from
the binary editor) are also done. Last M6 unit: CSV import/export (`rangeTransfer`). After that, M6
— Advanced training is COMPLETE and the roadmap moves to **M7 — Cloud, sync, and sharing**.

## Next slice

**Slice 52 — CSV import/export (completes M6)**

Milestone: M6 — Advanced training (web v3.2 import/export ecosystem, "CSV import"). A clipboard
CSV panel in the binary editor: export the current range's hands as CSV and import a CSV back into
the range. Mirror the existing mobile `RangeNotation` / `ActionNotation` clipboard components.

Context: `formatRangeCsv(range): string` emits a summary block (`name,…`, counts) + a `hand`
column; `parseRangeCsv(csv): { name?: string; hands: PokerHand[] }` reads the optional name row and
the hand column back, validating each hand and throwing a clear `Error` on a missing/empty `hand`
column or an invalid hand. CSV is a hands-only interchange (no actions/frequencies).

Reuse (verified — read `src/domain/rangeTransfer.ts` `formatRangeCsv` / `parseRangeCsv`, and the
mobile `RangeNotation.tsx` to mirror the copy/paste/apply UX):
- `@core/domain/rangeTransfer` `formatRangeCsv(range: SavedRange): string`,
  `parseRangeCsv(csv): { name?: string; hands: PokerHand[] }`.
- `@core/types/range` `SavedRange`; `@core/domain/pokerHands` `PokerHand`; `expo-clipboard`.

Task (mobile-only; reuse `@core`, do not edit `src/`): add a `RangeCsv` RN component in
`mobile/components/RangeCsv.tsx` with props `{ name: string; hands: PokerHand[]; onImport: (result:
{ name?: string; hands: PokerHand[] }) => void }`. Show the current CSV (`formatRangeCsv` over a
minimal `{ name, hands }` cast to `SavedRange` — it only reads name+hands), a "Copy" button, a paste
TextInput + "Apply" that runs `parseRangeCsv` and calls `onImport`, surfacing parse errors inline.
Render it in `mobile/app/editor.tsx` (after `RangeNotation`), wiring `onImport` to set the name (when
present) and replace the selected hands (reuse the editor's `onReplaceHands` + `setName`).

Tests (RNTL, mirroring `range-notation.test.tsx` / `action-notation.test.tsx`, with `expo-clipboard`
mocked): the component renders the formatted CSV for a name + hands; applying a valid pasted CSV
(`hand` column, optional `name,` row) calls `onImport` with the parsed `{ name?, hands }`; applying
malformed text (no `hand` column) shows an error and does not call `onImport`.

Files: add `mobile/components/RangeCsv.tsx` + `mobile/__tests__/range-csv.test.tsx`; edit
`mobile/app/editor.tsx` (render it + wire `onImport`). No `src/` edits, no new dependency.

Validation (mobile only): `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`,
`npm run bundle-check` — all must pass.

Constraints: reuse `@core/domain/rangeTransfer` for format/parse (no hand-rolled CSV); component in
`mobile/components/`; mirror `RangeNotation`'s clipboard UX. Do not edit `src/`. This completes M6 —
the next slice opens **M7 — Cloud, sync, and sharing**.

Suggested commit message:
`feat(ios): add CSV import/export to the range editor`

(End with the standard `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.)

## Deferred / candidate slices (not yet queued)

- **Weakness-focused drill** — likely redundant with the slice-27 mistakes-only toggle;
  reconsider whether it adds value before building.
- **Per-hand notes** (M6) — `SavedRange.handNotes` already exists in `@core`; a notes editor on
  the (action or binary) editor is a small, self-contained M6 slice that needs no postflop UX.
