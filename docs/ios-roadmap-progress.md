# iOS roadmap slice progress

State file for the [`build-ios-app`](../.claude/skills/build-ios-app/SKILL.md)
skill. The skill reads this file on every invocation to find the next slice to
build, and rewrites it as part of each committed slice. You can hand-edit the
**Next slice** prompt below to steer what gets built next — the skill uses
whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`ios-roadmap.md`](./ios-roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, separation of concerns) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- This is a **separate track** from the web roadmap's
  [`roadmap-progress.md`](./roadmap-progress.md); the two never collide.
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken
  in milestone order — never a whole milestone at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline

Nothing built yet. The web app (`src/`) is complete through web-roadmap v6 and is
the source of the reusable `@core` logic. The iOS app does not exist; `mobile/`
has not been created.

The first target is **M0 — Foundation: Expo app + shared-core reuse**.

**M5 — Practice depth: COMPLETE** (slices 23–38). The full training suite is on device:
mistakes review, per-range/per-hand stats, weakest-hands, mistakes-only drill, accuracy
heatmap, build-from-memory, practice-mode picker, timed drill, swipe-to-answer + haptics,
session history, spaced repetition (record + due-badge + streak), and the multi-action
cluster (editor, quiz, notation). **M6 — Advanced training** is underway: board explorer
(slice 39), range-vs-board overlay (slice 40), and postflop decision practice (slice 41).
**Combo cluster COMPLETE** (slices 42–45): combo explorer, `ComboSelector` component, per-hand
combo refinement persisted as `comboSelections` in the editor, and the blocker-aware combo drill
(a practice mode dealing unblocked combos, honoring `comboSelections` via `selectionForRange`).
**Mixed-frequency cluster COMPLETE** (slices 46–49): the `MixedStrategyEditor` component, a
frequency-editor screen persisting `mixedStrategies`, a primary-action quiz, and notation
import/export. Remaining in M6: range diff (`rangeDiff`), per-hand notes (`handNotes`), and CSV
import (`rangeTransfer`).

## Next slice

**Slice 50 — Range diff view (compare two ranges)**

Milestone: M6 — Advanced training (web v5 "compare two ranges / range diff view"). Compare two
saved ranges by membership and show common / only-A / only-B hands. Mirror the web
`src/components/RangeDiffView.tsx`.

Context: `diffRanges(a, b): RangeDiff` splits two hand lists into `{ common, onlyA, onlyB }` in
canonical order; `diffSummary(diff)` gives the three counts. Pure `@core` logic; this slice is the
screen over it.

Reuse (verified — read `src/domain/rangeDiff.ts` + `src/components/RangeDiffView.tsx`):
- `@core/domain/rangeDiff` `diffRanges(a: PokerHand[], b: PokerHand[]): RangeDiff`
  (`{ common, onlyA, onlyB }`), `diffSummary(diff): { common, onlyA, onlyB }`.
- `@core/storage/rangeStorage` `loadSavedRanges`, `findSavedRangeById`; `@core/types/range`
  `SavedRange`; `@core/domain/pokerHands` `PokerHand`.

DESIGN NOTE (resolve when building): reach a `mobile/app/diff.tsx` screen with `?id=<rangeA>` from
a library-card "Compare" action (mirrors the web's per-range compare), or from a home/header link;
pick the simplest that fits the existing `index.tsx` card/header layout. On the screen, load range A
and let the user pick range B from a chip list of the other saved ranges, then render the diff.
Presentation: at minimum the three summary counts (`diffSummary`) plus the only-A / only-B / common
hands as labeled chip groups; a tri-color 13×13 grid mirroring `RangeDiffView` is a nice-to-have if
it stays simple (a small read-only grid colored by membership) — otherwise keep the chip groups.

Task (mobile-only; reuse `@core`, do not edit `src/`): add `mobile/app/diff.tsx`; pick range B;
compute `diffRanges(rangeA.hands, rangeB.hands)`; show `diffSummary` counts + the partitioned hands.
Add the entry point (library card action or header link) to reach it.

Tests (RNTL): with two seeded ranges, selecting range B renders the correct common / only-A /
only-B counts (assert via `diffSummary`-backed testIDs). Reuse the storage shim + expo-router mocks.
If a small pure helper is extracted, unit-test it instead/too.

Files: add `mobile/app/diff.tsx` + `mobile/__tests__/diff-screen.test.tsx`; edit the entry-point
screen (`mobile/app/index.tsx`). No `src/` edits, no new dependency.

Validation (mobile only): `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`,
`npm run bundle-check` — all must pass.

Constraints: reuse `@core/domain/rangeDiff` for all comparison logic (no hand-rolled set math);
screen in `mobile/app/`. Do not edit `src/`.

Suggested commit message:
`feat(ios): add a range diff view to compare two ranges`

(End with the standard `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.)

## Deferred / candidate slices (not yet queued)

- **Weakness-focused drill** — likely redundant with the slice-27 mistakes-only toggle;
  reconsider whether it adds value before building.
- **Per-hand notes** (M6) — `SavedRange.handNotes` already exists in `@core`; a notes editor on
  the (action or binary) editor is a small, self-contained M6 slice that needs no postflop UX.
