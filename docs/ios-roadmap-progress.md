# iOS roadmap slice progress

State file for the [`build-ios-app`](../.claude/skills/build-ios-app/SKILL.md)
skill. The skill reads this file on every invocation to find the next slice to
build, and rewrites it as part of each committed slice. You can hand-edit the
**Next slice** prompt below to steer what gets built next — the skill uses
whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`ios-roadmap.md`](./ios-roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, separation of concerns) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- This is a **separate track** from the web roadmap's
  [`roadmap-progress.md`](./roadmap-progress.md); the two never collide.
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken
  in milestone order — never a whole milestone at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline

Nothing built yet. The web app (`src/`) is complete through web-roadmap v6 and is
the source of the reusable `@core` logic. The iOS app does not exist; `mobile/`
has not been created.

The first target is **M0 — Foundation: Expo app + shared-core reuse**.

**M5 — Practice depth: COMPLETE** (slices 23–38). The full training suite is on device:
mistakes review, per-range/per-hand stats, weakest-hands, mistakes-only drill, accuracy
heatmap, build-from-memory, practice-mode picker, timed drill, swipe-to-answer + haptics,
session history, spaced repetition (record + due-badge + streak), and the multi-action
cluster (editor, quiz, notation). **M6 — Advanced training** is underway: board explorer
(slice 39), range-vs-board overlay (slice 40), postflop decision practice (slice 41), and the
combo-level work — combo explorer (slice 42), `ComboSelector` component (slice 43), and
per-hand combo refinement persisted as `comboSelections` in the editor (slice 44). Remaining in
the combo cluster: the blocker-aware combo drill (`blockerPractice`); then mixed frequencies,
range diff, per-hand notes, and CSV import.

## Next slice

**Slice 45 — Blocker-aware combo drill (completes the combo cluster)**

Milestone: M6 — Advanced training (web v4.1 "combo-level precision"). Final unit of the combo
cluster, after enumeration (42), the `ComboSelector` component (43), and combo refinement in the
editor (44). A practice screen that deals a concrete combo from a saved range that a board (dead
cards) does not block, honoring the range's `comboSelections`. Mirror the web `ComboBlockerDrill`.

Context: given a range's hand classes + a board, only some concrete combos remain unblocked. The
drill lets the user type a board, see how many combos remain, and deal a random unblocked combo —
exploratory, no persisted stats (matches the web component). The eligible combos are further
restricted by the range's combo refinements via `selectionForRange`.

Reuse (verified — read `src/domain/blockerPractice.ts` + `src/components/ComboBlockerDrill.tsx`
to confirm shapes before building):
- `@core/domain/blockerPractice` `availablePracticeCombos(hands, dead, selection?): Card[][]`,
  `drawPracticeCombo(hands, dead, selection?): Card[]` (read the exact signatures/arg order).
- `@core/domain/comboSelection` `selectionForRange(hands, comboSelections?): ComboSelection`
  (so refinements from slice 44 are honored).
- `@core/domain/cards` `parseBoard`, `formatCard`, `type Card`; `@core/storage/rangeStorage`
  `findSavedRangeById`; `@core/types/range` `SavedRange`.

Task (mobile-only; reuse `@core`, do not edit `src/`): a `mobile/app/blocker-drill.tsx` screen
reached from the practice-mode picker (`?id=<rangeId>`, like action-quiz / postflop). Load the
range; build `selection = selectionForRange(range.hands, range.comboSelections)`. A board
TextInput (dead cards); show the remaining-combo count via `availablePracticeCombos(...).length`
(parse errors shown inline, empty board = no dead cards); a "Deal combo" button that shows a
random `drawPracticeCombo(...)` result (suit-colored cards). Add the picker entry in
`mobile/app/practice-modes.tsx`. Extract any parse/availability glue into a small pure helper in
`mobile/components/` if it makes the logic testable without rendering.

Tests: on the pure helper (or the parse logic) — a known range + board yields the expected
remaining count and excludes blocked combos (e.g. range `['AKs']`, board `As` → 3 combos, none
using As); an empty board yields all combos; an invalid board reports an error. Update
`practice-modes-screen.test.tsx` to assert the new mode entry.

Files: add `mobile/app/blocker-drill.tsx` (+ small helper + test); edit
`mobile/app/practice-modes.tsx` (+ its test). No `src/` edits, no new dependency.

Validation (mobile only): `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`,
`npm run bundle-check` — all must pass.

Constraints: reuse `@core/domain/blockerPractice` + `selectionForRange` for all combo/blocker
logic (no hand-rolled enumeration or dead-card removal); screen in `mobile/app/`, any pure helper
in `mobile/components/`. Do not edit `src/`.

Suggested commit message:
`feat(ios): add blocker-aware combo drill`

## Deferred / candidate slices (not yet queued)

- **Weakness-focused drill** — likely redundant with the slice-27 mistakes-only toggle;
  reconsider whether it adds value before building.
- **Per-hand notes** (M6) — `SavedRange.handNotes` already exists in `@core`; a notes editor on
  the (action or binary) editor is a small, self-contained M6 slice that needs no postflop UX.
