# iOS roadmap slice progress

State file for the [`build-ios-app`](../.claude/skills/build-ios-app/SKILL.md)
skill. The skill reads this file on every invocation to find the next slice to
build, and rewrites it as part of each committed slice. You can hand-edit the
**Next slice** prompt below to steer what gets built next — the skill uses
whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`ios-roadmap.md`](./ios-roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, separation of concerns) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- This is a **separate track** from the web roadmap's
  [`roadmap-progress.md`](./roadmap-progress.md); the two never collide.
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken
  in milestone order — never a whole milestone at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline

Nothing built yet. The web app (`src/`) is complete through web-roadmap v6 and is
the source of the reusable `@core` logic. The iOS app does not exist; `mobile/`
has not been created.

The first target is **M0 — Foundation: Expo app + shared-core reuse**.

**M5 — Practice depth: COMPLETE** (slices 23–38). The full training suite is on device:
mistakes review, per-range/per-hand stats, weakest-hands, mistakes-only drill, accuracy
heatmap, build-from-memory, practice-mode picker, timed drill, swipe-to-answer + haptics,
session history, spaced repetition (record + due-badge + streak), and the multi-action
cluster (editor, quiz, notation). **M6 — Advanced training** is underway: board explorer
(slice 39), range-vs-board overlay (slice 40), and postflop decision practice (slice 41).
**Combo cluster COMPLETE** (slices 42–45): combo explorer, `ComboSelector` component, per-hand
combo refinement persisted as `comboSelections` in the editor, and the blocker-aware combo drill
(a practice mode dealing unblocked combos, honoring `comboSelections` via `selectionForRange`).
**Mixed-frequency cluster** begun: the controlled `MixedStrategyEditor` component (slice 46 —
per-action −/+ steppers, not yet wired in). Next: a frequency-editor screen persisting
`mixedStrategies`, then the mixed quiz and mixed notation — then range diff, per-hand notes, and
CSV import.

## Next slice

**Slice 47 — Frequency-editor screen + persist `mixedStrategies`**

Milestone: M6 — Advanced training (web v4.2 "mixed-frequency strategies"). Second unit of the
mixed cluster: a screen that wires the `MixedStrategyEditor` (slice 46) to a saved range and
persists per-hand strategies as `SavedRange.mixedStrategies`, analogous to how the action editor
(`mobile/app/action-editor.tsx`) edits `handActions` and slice 44 persisted `comboSelections`.

Context: the web stores `mixedStrategies: Record<PokerHand, HandMixedStrategy>` and edits it with a
per-hand active selection (`handleEditFrequencies` seeds the draft from `range.mixedStrategies` and
sets the active hand to `range.hands[0]`; `handleSaveFrequencies` writes `mixedStrategies:
freqDraft`). Mirror that: pick an in-range hand, edit its strategy, persist the map.

Reuse (verified — read `mobile/app/action-editor.tsx`, plus `src/App.tsx` `handleEditFrequencies`
/ `handleSaveFrequencies` to mirror seed/persist semantics):
- `mobile/components/MixedStrategyEditor` (slice 46).
- `@core/domain/mixedStrategy` `type HandMixedStrategy`, `normalizeMixedStrategy`, `primaryAction`
  (if a per-hand summary chip is shown).
- `@core/storage/rangeStorage` `findSavedRangeById`, `saveSavedRange`; `@core/types/range`
  `SavedRange` (`mixedStrategies?`).

DESIGN NOTE (resolve when building): a dedicated `mobile/app/frequency-editor.tsx` reached from the
binary editor via an "Edit frequencies →" link (next to "Edit actions →"), mirroring how
action-editor is reached. Use a hand-picker (chips of the range's hands) + the `MixedStrategyEditor`
for the active hand. Persist on change (live-save, reading the stored range fresh and merging so
other overlays survive, exactly like action-editor / the binary editor), or on an explicit save —
match action-editor's approach for consistency. A hand whose normalized strategy is empty should
not keep an entry.

Task (mobile-only; reuse `@core`, do not edit `src/`): add `mobile/app/frequency-editor.tsx`; seed
a `mixedStrategies` draft from the loaded range; let the user pick an in-range hand and edit it via
`MixedStrategyEditor`; persist `mixedStrategies` onto the `SavedRange` (preserving handActions,
favorite, comboSelections, etc.). Add the "Edit frequencies →" link in `mobile/app/editor.tsx`.

Tests (RNTL, mirroring `action-editor-screen.test.tsx` + the storage shim): editing a hand's
strategy persists a `mixedStrategies` entry for that hand; other overlay fields (e.g. handActions)
survive the save. Reuse the editor test harness (storage shim + expo-router mocks).

Files: add `mobile/app/frequency-editor.tsx` + `mobile/__tests__/frequency-editor-screen.test.tsx`;
edit `mobile/app/editor.tsx` (add the link). No `src/` edits, no new dependency.

Validation (mobile only): `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`,
`npm run bundle-check` — all must pass.

Constraints: reuse `@core/domain/mixedStrategy` + the slice-46 component (no hand-rolled strategy
math); preserve other overlays on save (read fresh + merge, like action-editor); screen in
`mobile/app/`. Do not edit `src/`.

Suggested commit message:
`feat(ios): add a mixed-frequency editor screen persisting mixedStrategies`

(End with the standard `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.)

## Deferred / candidate slices (not yet queued)

- **Weakness-focused drill** — likely redundant with the slice-27 mistakes-only toggle;
  reconsider whether it adds value before building.
- **Per-hand notes** (M6) — `SavedRange.handNotes` already exists in `@core`; a notes editor on
  the (action or binary) editor is a small, self-contained M6 slice that needs no postflop UX.
