# iOS roadmap slice progress

State file for the [`build-ios-app`](../.claude/skills/build-ios-app/SKILL.md)
skill. The skill reads this file on every invocation to find the next slice to
build, and rewrites it as part of each committed slice. You can hand-edit the
**Next slice** prompt below to steer what gets built next — the skill uses
whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`ios-roadmap.md`](./ios-roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, separation of concerns) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- This is a **separate track** from the web roadmap's
  [`roadmap-progress.md`](./roadmap-progress.md); the two never collide.
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken
  in milestone order — never a whole milestone at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline

Nothing built yet. The web app (`src/`) is complete through web-roadmap v6 and is
the source of the reusable `@core` logic. The iOS app does not exist; `mobile/`
has not been created.

The first target is **M0 — Foundation: Expo app + shared-core reuse**.

**M5 — Practice depth: COMPLETE** (slices 23–38). The full training suite is on device:
mistakes review, per-range/per-hand stats, weakest-hands, mistakes-only drill, accuracy
heatmap, build-from-memory, practice-mode picker, timed drill, swipe-to-answer + haptics,
session history, spaced repetition (record + due-badge + streak), and the multi-action
cluster (editor, quiz, notation). **M6 — Advanced training** is underway: board explorer
(slice 39), range-vs-board overlay (slice 40), and postflop decision practice (slice 41).
**Combo cluster COMPLETE** (slices 42–45): combo explorer, `ComboSelector` component, per-hand
combo refinement persisted as `comboSelections` in the editor, and the blocker-aware combo drill
(a practice mode dealing unblocked combos, honoring `comboSelections` via `selectionForRange`).
**Mixed-frequency cluster** underway: the `MixedStrategyEditor` component (slice 46) and a
frequency-editor screen persisting `mixedStrategies`, reached from the binary editor (slice 47).
Next: the mixed-action quiz, then mixed notation — then range diff, per-hand notes, and CSV import.

## Next slice

**Slice 48 — Mixed-action quiz (primary-action recall)**

Milestone: M6 — Advanced training (web v4.2 "mixed-frequency strategies"). Third unit of the mixed
cluster: a practice mode quizzing the PRIMARY action of each hand that carries a mixed strategy.
Structurally almost identical to the existing `mobile/app/action-quiz.tsx`; mirror it and the web
`src/components/MixedActionQuiz.tsx`.

Context: the quiz pool is `handsWithMixedStrategy(range.mixedStrategies)` (hands with a non-empty
strategy, slice 47 lets the user create these). For a drawn hand the correct answer is
`primaryAction(strategy) ?? 'fold'`; the user picks a `RangeAction` and gets feedback + a "Next
hand" loop with running stats. No persistence (matches the web component).

Reuse (verified — read `src/components/MixedActionQuiz.tsx` + `mobile/app/action-quiz.tsx`):
- `@core/domain/mixedStrategy` `handsWithMixedStrategy(mixedStrategies): PokerHand[]`,
  `primaryAction(strategy): RangeAction | null`.
- `@core/domain/practice` `getRandomHandFrom(pool, random?)`; `@core/domain/accuracy`
  `accuracyPercentage`; `@core/types/range` `RANGE_ACTIONS`, `RANGE_ACTION_LABELS`, `RangeAction`;
  `@core/storage/rangeStorage` `findSavedRangeById`; `mobile/theme/actionColors` `ACTION_COLORS`.

Task (mobile-only; reuse `@core`, do not edit `src/`): a `mobile/app/mixed-quiz.tsx` screen reached
from the practice-mode picker (`?id=<rangeId>`, like action-quiz). Build the pool; if empty, show
"assign frequencies first". Otherwise draw a hand (`getRandomHandFrom`), ask "What is the primary
action?", score the pick against `primaryAction(strategy) ?? 'fold'` with feedback + a "Next hand"
button + running total/correct/accuracy. Add the picker entry in `mobile/app/practice-modes.tsx`.

Tests (RNTL, mirroring `action-quiz-screen.test.tsx`): seed a range whose `mixedStrategies` has
exactly ONE hand (so the draw is deterministic); pressing the primary action scores Correct and
pressing a different action scores Incorrect; an empty-pool range shows the "assign frequencies"
message. Update `practice-modes-screen.test.tsx` for the new mode entry.

Files: add `mobile/app/mixed-quiz.tsx` + `mobile/__tests__/mixed-quiz-screen.test.tsx`; edit
`mobile/app/practice-modes.tsx` (+ its test). No `src/` edits, no new dependency.

Validation (mobile only): `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run`,
`npm run bundle-check` — all must pass.

Constraints: reuse `@core/domain/mixedStrategy` (`handsWithMixedStrategy`, `primaryAction`) for the
pool + scoring (no hand-rolled logic); screen in `mobile/app/`. Do not edit `src/`.

Suggested commit message:
`feat(ios): add a mixed-frequency primary-action quiz`

(End with the standard `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.)

## Deferred / candidate slices (not yet queued)

- **Weakness-focused drill** — likely redundant with the slice-27 mistakes-only toggle;
  reconsider whether it adds value before building.
- **Per-hand notes** (M6) — `SavedRange.handNotes` already exists in `@core`; a notes editor on
  the (action or binary) editor is a small, self-contained M6 slice that needs no postflop UX.
