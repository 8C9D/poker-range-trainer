# Roadmap slice progress

State file for the `roadmap-slice` skill. The skill reads this file on every
invocation to find the next slice to build, and rewrites it as part of each
committed slice. You can hand-edit the **Next slice** prompt below to steer what
gets built next — the skill uses whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, what's out of scope) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken in
  roadmap order — never a whole version at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline (built before this skill existed)

As of commit `f8f4e83`, these roadmap versions are complete:

- **v1** — 13×13 grid, click-to-toggle, named ranges, local save/view/edit/delete,
  practice mode, session stats.
- **v1.1** — drag-select painting, range shortcut buttons, live range percentage and
  combo counts.
- **v1.2** — range notation parser/exporter (import, export, copy, dash ranges).
- **v1.3** — optional scenario metadata and the metadata editor fields.

The next roadmap target is **v1.4 — Range library and filtering**.

With slice 17 the **v1.4 — Range library and filtering** version is fully
implemented (name search; position/action/stack/game filters; name / recently
edited / recently practiced / accuracy sorts; duplicate, archive, and favorite;
and range cards summarizing name, scenario, percent, last-practiced, and
accuracy).

**v2 — Improved practice modes** is now underway. Slice 18 added practice mode 4
("Missing hands review"): ending a session opens a review step that recaps the
session stats and lists the mistakes — hands missed (in range, answered out) and
hands wrongly included (out of range, answered in) — before the final summary is
persisted on dismiss. Slice 19 began mode 3 ("Build from memory") with its pure
domain foundation: `compareBuiltRange(target, built)` normalizes both inputs and
splits them into `correct` / `missed` / `extra` lists in canonical order. Slice 20
added the standalone `BuildFromMemoryPractice` component: it shows a saved range's
name, lets the user rebuild it on a blank `HandGrid` from memory, and on "Check my
range" uses `compareBuiltRange` to report correct/missed/added-by-mistake hands
(with a "Try again" and "Back to library"). Slice 21 wired mode 3 into `App` behind
a practice-mode picker: clicking "Practice" on a library card now shows a picker that
launches either the existing recognition mode (mode 1) or build-from-memory (mode 3),
with the mode reset on every exit. With that, **mode 3 is fully delivered**
(comparison helper + component + picker wiring). Recognition still records per-range
stats; build-from-memory deliberately does not (different metric shape).

Mode 5 ("Timed drill") is now underway. Slice 22 added its pure domain foundation,
`src/domain/timedDrill.ts`: `DRILL_DURATION_OPTIONS` ([30, 60, 120]s),
`DEFAULT_DRILL_SECONDS` (60), and `getRemainingSeconds` / `isDrillOver` countdown math
that takes the current time as a parameter (clamped, ceil-rounded, clock-skew safe).
Slice 23 added the standalone `TimedDrillSession` component: a config → running →
done flow that reuses recognition scoring (`createPracticeAttempt`,
`summarizePracticeAttempts`) and drives the countdown off `getRemainingSeconds` plus a
250ms interval (clock read only inside the interval to keep render pure; interval
cleaned up on expiry/unmount). It reports a `PracticeSessionSummary` via `onExit`. It
is fully tested (with Vitest fake timers + `fireEvent`, since userEvent deadlocks
against fake timers) but not yet wired into `App`.

Slice 24 wired the timed drill into the practice-mode picker as a third mode
("Timed drill"), routing its `onExit` summary through `handleEndPractice` so timed
sessions record into the same per-range recognition stats. With that, **mode 5 is fully
delivered** (countdown helpers + component + picker wiring). The picker now offers
recognition, build-from-memory, and timed drill.

Mode 6 ("Weakness-focused drill") is now underway. Slice 25 added its pure domain
foundation, `src/domain/weaknessDrill.ts`: `WEAKNESS_MISTAKE_WEIGHT` (3),
`buildWeaknessPool(attempts)` (each hand once plus extra copies per incorrect attempt),
and `getWeaknessFocusedHand(attempts, random)` (a pool-weighted draw that is uniform
with no mistakes and biases toward missed hands otherwise). This is an *in-session*
weakness signal from the current session's attempts; cross-session per-hand accuracy
tracking is the separate v2.1 work.

Slice 26 added the standalone `WeaknessFocusedDrill` component, and slice 27 wired it
into the picker as a fourth mode ("Weakness drill"), routing its `onExit` through
`handleEndPractice` so it records into per-range stats.

**v2 — Improved practice modes is now COMPLETE.** The practice-mode picker offers
recognition (mode 1), build-from-memory (mode 3), timed drill (mode 5), and weakness
drill (mode 6); mode 4 (missing-hands review) lives on the recognition session. Mode 2
("Pick the correct action") remains intentionally deferred to **v2.3**'s multi-action
range model (per the roadmap and finish-v2 scope).

**v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review** is now underway. Slice 28 added the pure domain
foundation: the `HandAccuracyStat` type (`hand`, `attempts`, `correct`,
`falsePositives`, `falseNegatives`) and `summarizeHandAccuracy(attempts)` in
`src/domain/practice.ts`, which tallies a session's attempts per hand in canonical order
(every incorrect attempt is exactly one of FP/FN, so `falsePositives + falseNegatives ===
attempts - correct`).

Slice 29 added the persistence: `src/storage/handAccuracyStorage.ts`
(`loadHandAccuracy`, `recordHandAccuracy`) plus the `RangeHandAccuracy` type alias,
mirroring `practiceStatsStorage` (single versioned key, defensive validation, fold-a-
session recording). It is tested directly but not yet called from the app.

Slice 30 wired the recording in: the recognition-style components (recognize/timed/
weakness) now report their raw session `attempts` via `onExit`, and `App.handleEndPractice`
derives and persists BOTH the per-range summary (`recordPracticeSession`) and the per-hand
accuracy (`recordHandAccuracy(summarizeHandAccuracy(attempts))`). Build-from-memory and the
picker cancel are unchanged. Per-hand mistake data is now captured every session.

Still to come in v2.1: surface the data — a range-specific performance view, a heatmap
overlay on the grid, a "practice mistakes only" mode, and session history. The next slice
adds the pure presentation helpers (per-hand accuracy rate + a weakest-first ranking) that
those views read, keeping the later UI slices small.

## Next slice

- **Number:** 31
- **Roadmap target:** v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review
- **Working title:** Per-hand accuracy presentation helpers (rate + weakest-first ranking)

### Prompt

You are implementing roadmap slice 31, continuing **v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review**.
Per-hand accuracy is now aggregated (slice 28) and persisted every session (slices
29–30). This slice adds the pure PRESENTATION helpers the upcoming v2.1 views (range
performance page, heatmap overlay) will use to turn cumulative `RangeHandAccuracy` into
display-ready, ranked data. Following the established rhythm, this is a pure-domain slice;
the views that consume these helpers are the next slices.

Scope of THIS slice (foundation only): two pure functions + tests. No UI, no storage
changes.

Context (read these before starting):
- `src/types/practice.ts` — `HandAccuracyStat` (`hand`, `attempts`, `correct`,
  `falsePositives`, `falseNegatives`) and `RangeHandAccuracy = Record<PokerHand,
  HandAccuracyStat>` (cumulative per-hand stats for one range, keyed by hand).
- `src/domain/practice.ts` — has `summarizeHandAccuracy`, `summarizePracticeAttempts`
  (whose `accuracyPercentage` is `correct/total*100`, 0 when total is 0 — match that
  convention), and imports `ALL_HANDS` + `type PokerHand`. Add the new helpers here.
- `src/domain/practice.test.ts` — mirror its pure-domain test patterns.

Task — add two pure functions to `src/domain/practice.ts`:
- `handAccuracyRate(stat: HandAccuracyStat): number` — `stat.correct / stat.attempts *
  100`, or `0` when `attempts === 0` (never NaN), matching `summarizePracticeAttempts`'s
  accuracy convention. Doc comment in the same style.
- `rankHandAccuracy(rangeStats: RangeHandAccuracy): HandAccuracyStat[]` — return the
  range's per-hand stats (those with `attempts > 0`) sorted WEAKEST-FIRST so the worst
  hands surface for review:
  1. ascending `handAccuracyRate` (lower accuracy first),
  2. tiebreak by MORE `attempts` first (a 0%-of-10 hand outranks a 0%-of-1 hand),
  3. final tiebreak by canonical 13×13 order (reuse `ALL_HANDS`) for stable, deterministic
     output.
  Do not mutate the input. Doc comment explaining the ordering.

Tests to add (`src/domain/practice.test.ts`, new describes):
- `handAccuracyRate`: 0 attempts → 0 (not NaN); 3/4 → 75; 0/5 → 0; 2/2 → 100.
- `rankHandAccuracy`:
  - empty map → `[]`;
  - lower-accuracy hands come before higher-accuracy ones;
  - equal accuracy → the hand with more attempts comes first;
  - equal accuracy AND equal attempts → canonical order (e.g. "AA" before "KK");
  - only includes hands with `attempts > 0`;
  - does not mutate the input object.

Validation (all must pass before committing):
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:run`
- `npm run build`

Constraints:
- Stay within this slice: ONLY `handAccuracyRate` and `rankHandAccuracy` plus tests. No
  UI, no storage changes, no new mode.
- Keep the helpers pure and in `src/domain/`.
- No backend, accounts, solver imports, postflop, mixed frequencies, or AI.
- Keep the change small and reversible.

Suggested commit message:
- `feat: add per-hand accuracy rate and weakest-first ranking helpers`
