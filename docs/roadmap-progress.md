# Roadmap slice progress

State file for the `roadmap-slice` skill. The skill reads this file on every
invocation to find the next slice to build, and rewrites it as part of each
committed slice. You can hand-edit the **Next slice** prompt below to steer what
gets built next — the skill uses whatever is here.

- Scope and ordering come from [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md).
- Project rules (validation, commit style, what's out of scope) come from
  [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- The full text of any past slice prompt is recoverable from this file's git
  history (each slice commit rewrites the **Next slice** section).

## Slice model

- A **slice** is one small, focused, reversible, commit-sized unit of work taken in
  roadmap order — never a whole version at once.
- Each slice produces exactly one commit and advances the **Next slice** pointer.
- Slice numbers are sequential integers, assigned by the skill, never reused.

## Baseline (built before this skill existed)

As of commit `f8f4e83`, these roadmap versions are complete:

- **v1** — 13×13 grid, click-to-toggle, named ranges, local save/view/edit/delete,
  practice mode, session stats.
- **v1.1** — drag-select painting, range shortcut buttons, live range percentage and
  combo counts.
- **v1.2** — range notation parser/exporter (import, export, copy, dash ranges).
- **v1.3** — optional scenario metadata and the metadata editor fields.

The next roadmap target is **v1.4 — Range library and filtering**.

With slice 17 the **v1.4 — Range library and filtering** version is fully
implemented (name search; position/action/stack/game filters; name / recently
edited / recently practiced / accuracy sorts; duplicate, archive, and favorite;
and range cards summarizing name, scenario, percent, last-practiced, and
accuracy).

**v2 — Improved practice modes** is now underway. Slice 18 added practice mode 4
("Missing hands review"): ending a session opens a review step that recaps the
session stats and lists the mistakes — hands missed (in range, answered out) and
hands wrongly included (out of range, answered in) — before the final summary is
persisted on dismiss. Slice 19 began mode 3 ("Build from memory") with its pure
domain foundation: `compareBuiltRange(target, built)` normalizes both inputs and
splits them into `correct` / `missed` / `extra` lists in canonical order. Slice 20
added the standalone `BuildFromMemoryPractice` component: it shows a saved range's
name, lets the user rebuild it on a blank `HandGrid` from memory, and on "Check my
range" uses `compareBuiltRange` to report correct/missed/added-by-mistake hands
(with a "Try again" and "Back to library"). Slice 21 wired mode 3 into `App` behind
a practice-mode picker: clicking "Practice" on a library card now shows a picker that
launches either the existing recognition mode (mode 1) or build-from-memory (mode 3),
with the mode reset on every exit. With that, **mode 3 is fully delivered**
(comparison helper + component + picker wiring). Recognition still records per-range
stats; build-from-memory deliberately does not (different metric shape).

Mode 5 ("Timed drill") is now underway. Slice 22 added its pure domain foundation,
`src/domain/timedDrill.ts`: `DRILL_DURATION_OPTIONS` ([30, 60, 120]s),
`DEFAULT_DRILL_SECONDS` (60), and `getRemainingSeconds` / `isDrillOver` countdown math
that takes the current time as a parameter (clamped, ceil-rounded, clock-skew safe).
Slice 23 added the standalone `TimedDrillSession` component: a config → running →
done flow that reuses recognition scoring (`createPracticeAttempt`,
`summarizePracticeAttempts`) and drives the countdown off `getRemainingSeconds` plus a
250ms interval (clock read only inside the interval to keep render pure; interval
cleaned up on expiry/unmount). It reports a `PracticeSessionSummary` via `onExit`. It
is fully tested (with Vitest fake timers + `fireEvent`, since userEvent deadlocks
against fake timers) but not yet wired into `App`.

Slice 24 wired the timed drill into the practice-mode picker as a third mode
("Timed drill"), routing its `onExit` summary through `handleEndPractice` so timed
sessions record into the same per-range recognition stats. With that, **mode 5 is fully
delivered** (countdown helpers + component + picker wiring). The picker now offers
recognition, build-from-memory, and timed drill.

Mode 6 ("Weakness-focused drill") is now underway. Slice 25 added its pure domain
foundation, `src/domain/weaknessDrill.ts`: `WEAKNESS_MISTAKE_WEIGHT` (3),
`buildWeaknessPool(attempts)` (each hand once plus extra copies per incorrect attempt),
and `getWeaknessFocusedHand(attempts, random)` (a pool-weighted draw that is uniform
with no mistakes and biases toward missed hands otherwise). This is an *in-session*
weakness signal from the current session's attempts; cross-session per-hand accuracy
tracking is the separate v2.1 work.

Slice 26 added the standalone `WeaknessFocusedDrill` component, and slice 27 wired it
into the picker as a fourth mode ("Weakness drill"), routing its `onExit` through
`handleEndPractice` so it records into per-range stats.

**v2 — Improved practice modes is now COMPLETE.** The practice-mode picker offers
recognition (mode 1), build-from-memory (mode 3), timed drill (mode 5), and weakness
drill (mode 6); mode 4 (missing-hands review) lives on the recognition session. Mode 2
("Pick the correct action") remains intentionally deferred to **v2.3**'s multi-action
range model (per the roadmap and finish-v2 scope).

**v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review** is now underway. Slice 28 added the pure domain
foundation: the `HandAccuracyStat` type (`hand`, `attempts`, `correct`,
`falsePositives`, `falseNegatives`) and `summarizeHandAccuracy(attempts)` in
`src/domain/practice.ts`, which tallies a session's attempts per hand in canonical order
(every incorrect attempt is exactly one of FP/FN, so `falsePositives + falseNegatives ===
attempts - correct`).

Slice 29 added the persistence: `src/storage/handAccuracyStorage.ts`
(`loadHandAccuracy`, `recordHandAccuracy`) plus the `RangeHandAccuracy` type alias,
mirroring `practiceStatsStorage` (single versioned key, defensive validation, fold-a-
session recording). It is tested directly but not yet called from the app.

Slice 30 wired the recording in: the recognition-style components (recognize/timed/
weakness) now report their raw session `attempts` via `onExit`, and `App.handleEndPractice`
derives and persists BOTH the per-range summary (`recordPracticeSession`) and the per-hand
accuracy (`recordHandAccuracy(summarizeHandAccuracy(attempts))`). Build-from-memory and the
picker cancel are unchanged. Per-hand mistake data is now captured every session.

Slice 31 added the pure presentation helpers in `src/domain/practice.ts`:
`handAccuracyRate(stat)` (correct/attempts %, 0 when none) and
`rankHandAccuracy(rangeStats)` (weakest-first: ascending accuracy, then more attempts,
then canonical order).

Slice 32 added the standalone `RangePerformance` component: a weakest-first per-hand table
(hand, accuracy %, attempts, missed, wrongly-included) from `rankHandAccuracy`, with an
empty state. It is fully tested but not yet reachable.

Slice 33 wired it in: each library card has a "Stats" action (`View stats for {name}`)
that opens `RangePerformance` for that range; `App` keeps a `handAccuracy` state
(`loadHandAccuracy`, refreshed after each session) and renders the view with that range's
per-hand map. The per-hand performance page is now reachable and live.

Still to come in v2.1: a heatmap overlay on the range grid; a "practice mistakes only"
mode; and session history. The next slice adds the pure `accuracyHeatLevel` helper that
buckets a hand's accuracy into untested/low/medium/high for the upcoming heatmap, keeping
the heatmap component slice small.

## Next slice

- **Number:** 34
- **Roadmap target:** v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review
- **Working title:** Accuracy heat-level helper (heatmap foundation)

### Prompt

You are implementing roadmap slice 34, continuing **v2.1 — Mistake tracking and review**.
The per-hand performance page (slices 28–33) is live. Next up is the "heatmap overlay on
the range grid" v2.1 feature. Following the established rhythm, THIS slice adds ONLY the
pure helper that buckets a hand's accuracy into a heat level; the read-only heatmap grid
component and its integration into the performance view are the next slices.

Scope of THIS slice (foundation only): one pure function + a small exported type + tests.
No component, no UI.

Context (read these before starting):
- `src/domain/practice.ts` — has `handAccuracyRate(stat)` (accuracy %, 0 when no
  attempts). Add the new helper here beside it. Imports `type PokerHand` from
  `./pokerHands` already.
- `src/types/practice.ts` — `HandAccuracyStat` (`hand`, `attempts`, `correct`,
  `falsePositives`, `falseNegatives`).
- `src/domain/practice.test.ts` — mirror its pure-domain test patterns.

Task — add to `src/domain/practice.ts`:
- `export type HeatLevel = 'untested' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'`.
- `accuracyHeatLevel(stat: HandAccuracyStat | undefined): HeatLevel`:
  - `'untested'` when `stat` is `undefined` or `stat.attempts === 0` (so hands never
    practiced read as untested),
  - otherwise bucket by `handAccuracyRate(stat)`: `< 50` → `'low'`, `< 80` → `'medium'`,
    `>= 80` → `'high'`.
  - Pure; doc comment in the same style noting the thresholds and the untested case.

Tests to add (`src/domain/practice.test.ts`, new `describe('accuracyHeatLevel', …)`):
- `undefined` → `'untested'`; a stat with `attempts: 0` → `'untested'`;
- 0% and 49% → `'low'`; exactly 50% and 79% → `'medium'`; exactly 80% and 100% → `'high'`
  (cover the 50 and 80 boundaries explicitly using attempts/correct that hit those rates,
  e.g. 1/2 = 50, 4/5 = 80, 3/4 = 75).

Validation (all must pass before committing):
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:run`
- `npm run build`

Constraints:
- Stay within this slice: ONLY the `HeatLevel` type, `accuracyHeatLevel`, and tests. No UI,
  no storage, no new mode.
- Keep it pure and in `src/domain/`.
- No backend, accounts, solver imports, postflop, mixed frequencies, or AI.
- Keep the change small and reversible.

Suggested commit message:
- `feat: add accuracy heat-level helper for the range heatmap`
